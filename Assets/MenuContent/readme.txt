Description: the menucontent folder contains everything required by the menu scene. Nothing needs to be
             changed. The scene fader prefab will add the fading before calling a new scene so use the method
             fadeto(int sceneindex) to go to the next level. The scene fader objects needs thus to be in every
             scene. 

How to use: go to file -> build settings-> have the menu scene as first (index 0) then add all the scenes
            in order that we want (to be decided later). This order will be the order of the levels
